# Siamese Network for Facial Verification
 This project explores the use of a Siamese neural network for facial verification. The network compares two input images and predicts whether they belong to the same individual. Through multiple experiments, we iteratively improved the model's performance by introducing architectural enhancements, data augmentation, and optimized hyperparameter tuning.
